### Who am I?
I am a student who has finally found an interest in writing. My interests vary from the arts to the sciences—social and natural—to the law.

### What will I write about?
A professor once said to me, when I was attempting and failing to form a thought, that "writing sharpens wit." This is my effort to heed his words. As one could expects, this means I will be writing about whatever my interest is at the time.
